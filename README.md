Mathland
=========
Mathland is a game I created for CSC 591 - Intelligent Game Based Learning Environments (IGBLE). A class focused around the Computing Research Association's grand challenge to "provide a teacher for every learner." Artificial intelligent, intelligent tutoring systems, pedagogical agents, student modeling, affective computing, and human-computer interaction are just a few of the topics that IGBLE encompasses.

Mathland takes place on an alien land under attack from enemies that can only be defeated by the player solving addition problems. 1st graders achieve simple addition mastery by quickly clicking on the addition problem attached to each enemy that matches the answer.
